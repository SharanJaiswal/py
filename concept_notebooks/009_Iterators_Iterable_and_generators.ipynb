    "# Iterables V/s Iterators\n",
    "An iterable is an object that contains a countable number of values, It can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values. Such objects basically implemets \\_\\_iter()\\_\\_ method. Since we can iterate through list hence LIST is iterable. All the items of iterables are allocated in the memory locations. Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, ans strings are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from. All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator.\n",

If we are required to get elements one by one, then we use iterator, and hence with the help of next() function we access the element one by one.\n",
    "    1. Unlike iterables, where all the values of it are initialized in the memory when it is created, iterators are not initialized in the memory when they are created.\n",
    "    2. When the in-built next(iterator) function is called, then only first value of the iterator is initialized in the memory.\n",
    "    3. When the elements are exhausted from the iterartors, next() function will throw an error.\n",
    "    4. To start from first element again, again make a iterator variable and then use next() function.\n",
    "    5. Remember that iterator object gets generated once calling iter(). So, everything needs to be done there only. next() is just for calling item one by one of iterator object."

    "They are created because they are used to create disguised iterators itself. Basically, we perform the working of iterator, but with the generator technique. At the end, not iterator,but generator is created.\n",
    "1. To create iteration, we use **iter()** keyword.\n",
    "2. To create generator, we use **yield** keyword, along with function where yield will be in place of **return**.\n",
    "3. **yield** saves the local variable value. It also returns the local variable value.\n",
    "4. Once iterator/generator is created, we use **next()** to access the value.\n",

    "7. Iterators are much more memory efficient.\n",

    "10. Hence, for loop can't be run over them, because there is no whole collection of output in the created generator object.\n",
